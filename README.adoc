= SpringBatch-filepoller

This is a Spring Batch application that reads data from a CSV file and writes it to a database. The data represents employee information, including their ID, first name, last name, email address, phone number, address, and date of joining.

== Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

=== Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven
* Spring Boot
* SQL database

=== Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

. Clone the repository to your local machine.
. Navigate to the project directory.
. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the application.

== Running the tests

The tests can be run by executing `mvn test` in the project directory. The tests include an integration test for the batch job, which reads from a CSV file and writes to a database.

== Code Explanation

The `@StepScope` annotation in Spring Batch is used to indicate that a bean should be scoped at the step level. This means that a new instance of the bean will be created each time a step is executed. This is particularly useful when you want to inject job parameters into your beans.

In this project, the `@StepScope` annotation is used on the `flatFileItemReader` bean. This means that a new `FlatFileItemReader` instance will be created for each step execution. The `@Value("#{jobParameters['inputFile']}")` expression inside the method parameters is a SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expression that allows you to inject the 'inputFile' job parameter into the `flatFileItemReader` bean. This wouldn't be possible without the `@StepScope` annotation because job parameters are only available at runtime, and by default, Spring beans are singleton scoped and are created at application startup.
